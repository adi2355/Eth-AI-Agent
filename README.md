# Blockchain AI Agent

## 1. Overview

The Blockchain AI Agent is a next-generation application merging natural language processing (NLP) with Ethereum blockchain functionality. It is intended to make blockchain interactions and cryptocurrency data retrieval as simple as chatting with a knowledgeable assistant.

Here's how it all comes together:

### Conversational AI

Users type questions or requests (e.g., "What's the current price of Ethereum?", "Deploy an ERC20 token named MyToken"), and the assistant responds in natural language.

Under the hood, the app uses OpenAI to interpret each user's query and infer their intent—whether it's purely informational (price checks, news) or operational (transfer tokens, deploy a contract).

### Multiple External Integrations

- **CoinGecko / CoinMarketCap**: Provides live cryptocurrency market data such as prices, market caps, volume, etc.
- **Ethereum RPC Providers** (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, or local Hardhat): Allows real on-chain operations like contract deployments and token transfers.
- **Next.js**: Serves as the full-stack framework, handling both the user-facing front end and back-end endpoints.

### Simplified Blockchain Operations

From the same chat interface, the user can instruct the system to connect a wallet (mock or real), send tokens, deploy new smart contracts, or check transaction statuses.

### Real-Time Transaction Monitoring

When a deployment or transfer transaction is submitted, the user receives status updates (pending, success, or failed) in real time.

Shows relevant on-chain data, such as transaction hashes and eventual confirmation.

### Contextual Conversation Memory

The system maintains a record of the entire conversation (message log, user preferences, favorite tokens, technical level, etc.).

This allows the agent to provide continuous context, so the user doesn't have to repeat themselves about which token or chain they are referencing.

### How It Addresses Common Pain Points

- **Layered Complexity**: By layering an AI chat interface over multiple technical components (smart contracts, APIs, wallet connections), it reduces friction for non-technical users.
- **Fragmented Data**: Instead of manually checking CoinGecko or multiple websites, the user can ask the agent for aggregated and formatted crypto data in one place.
- **Manual Wallet Operations**: Typically, users have to jump between a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and block explorer to do operations. Here, the chat automatically instructs the wallet (local, mock, or real) and returns transaction details right in the conversation.

## 2. Features

Below is a deeper look at the key capabilities in this application.

### 2.1 Natural Language Intent Analysis

- **Powered by OpenAI**: The system uses language models to interpret user queries in plain text.
- **Intents**: Queries are categorized as MARKET_DATA, DEPLOY_CONTRACT, TRANSFER_TOKENS, CONNECT_WALLET, TECHNICAL, DEFI, etc.
- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically identifies relevant addresses, token symbols, amounts, and contract templates (ERC20, NFT, etc.).
- **Confidence Levels**: Determines how certain it is about each intent and can prompt for clarification if needed.

**Example**:
User says, "Can you deploy an ERC20 token named MyToken with a total supply of 1,000,000?"

1. OpenAI classifies the intent as DEPLOY_CONTRACT.
2. It extracts "ERC20 token," "MyToken," and "1,000,000."
3. The Orchestrator then knows to run a contract deployment procedure with those values.

### 2.2 Smart Contract Deployment

- **Predefined Templates**: Common patterns like ERC20, ERC721 (NFT), and SimpleStorage are readily available.
- **Parameter Customization**: Name, symbol, initial supply, and more can be configured via the user's natural language.
- **Compiling & Deployment**: Utilizes a built-in pipeline (with the solc compiler) or references a precompiled bytecode for standard contracts.
- **Security Checks**: Performs basic checks on the code or bytecode to look for known vulnerabilities (like tx.origin, selfdestruct, etc.).

**Example**:
User says, "Deploy a token named TestToken with symbol TST and total supply of 500,000."

1. The system identifies an ERC20 contract.
2. Fills in placeholders in the source code.
3. Compiles and sends the deployment transaction to the blockchain.
4. Notifies the user of the transaction hash and status in real-time.

### 2.3 Token Transfers

- **ETH or Custom Token**: Users can transfer native ETH or any ERC20 token by specifying the address.
- **Auto-Parsing**: Captures "send 0.1 ETH to 0xABC..." from a simple chat message.
- **Transaction Lifecycle**: Reports transaction hash, pending status, and success/failure once mined.
- **Fallback for Mistyped Tokens**: If the user input is ambiguous, the system can prompt for confirmation or error out gracefully.

**Example**:
User says, "Send 0.1 ETH to 0x1234...5678."

1. The agent recognizes "transfer 0.1 ETH" → TRANSFER_TOKENS.
2. The Session Manager calls the wallet connection.
3. A new transaction is created with to = 0x1234...5678, value = 0.1 ETH.
4. The system logs the status of the transaction (pending → success).

### 2.4 Persistent Wallet Connections

- **Session-Based**: Once a user connects a wallet (mock or real), the session manager keeps it active so subsequent requests reuse the same address and chain.
- **Mock vs. Real**:
  - Mock Mode is used when USE_BLOCKCHAIN_MOCKS=true, letting you test interactions quickly without spending real ETH.
  - Real Mode connects to actual networks (mainnet, testnets, local Hardhat).
- **Handling Disconnections**: If a session is idle for too long or if the user explicitly disconnects, the session is cleared.

**Example**:
User says, "Connect my wallet."

1. The system calls the CONNECT_WALLET agent.
2. If the user environment supports it (e.g., MetaMask in a browser), it triggers a normal wallet connection flow.
3. On the server (or for testing), it can create a mock wallet.

### 2.5 Transaction Monitoring

- **Stateful Tracking**: A transaction registry is updated whenever a new transfer or contract deployment is initiated.
- **Event-Based Updates**: Listeners run in the background to watch for confirmations from the blockchain provider.
- **Status Changes**: Displays real-time feedback in the chat—"Transaction is pending… now confirmed with 3 confirmations."

**Example**:
User says, "What is the status of my last transaction?"

1. The system queries its transaction registry to see the last transaction.
2. If it's still pending, it reports how many confirmations are needed.
3. If success, it can also show the final contract address or the block number.

### 2.6 Conversation Context & Personalization

- **Conversation Store**: Maintains logs of the last N messages, as well as user preferences (favorite tokens, technical level).
- **Continuity**: AI references prior Q&As so you don't have to restate details. For instance, if you previously asked about "MyToken," the system knows you're talking about that same token in the next question.
- **Topic & Intent Linking**: Gauges the conversation's flow (via a continuity score) to detect if the user is pivoting topics drastically.

**Example**:
User says, "Earlier you told me MyToken is worth $2.50. Is that still accurate?"

1. The conversation store shows the system previously provided MyToken's price.
2. The aggregator checks for the new price.
3. The system clarifies whether the price changed significantly.

### 2.7 Error Handling & API Fallbacks

- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: If CoinGecko is rate-limited, it switches to CoinMarketCap automatically (and vice versa).
- **Exponential Retry**: For transient errors (network issues, partial timeouts), it attempts re-fetching data with backoff.
- **User Feedback**: The chat clarifies errors in plain language and can provide next steps ("Try again later," "Use fewer tokens," etc.).

**Example**:
If the user spams requests for 10+ tokens, the aggregator might respond, "You requested too many tokens at once. Please limit to 5 tokens per query or try again in a moment."

### 2.8 Additional Capabilities

- **Multi-Intent**: If a single request touches on multiple topics (e.g., "Compare BTC & ETH prices, then send me 0.01 ETH"), the agent segments them into sub-requests where appropriate.
- **News/Regulatory**: Rudimentary placeholders exist for searching external news feeds or regulatory data, though these require additional APIs or expansions.
- **Technical Analysis / On-Chain Analytics**: The code is structured so that advanced modules could be added (DeFi analytics, price predictions, etc.) with minimal friction.

## 3. Architecture

The Blockchain AI Agent is built as a microservices-inspired set of specialized modules within a unified Next.js application. It uses Next.js's server routes (`/api/...`) for endpoint definitions while delegating logic to domain-specific "agents" in the `lib/` directory.

### 3.1 High-Level Flow

**User Query → `/api/chat`**

- User's input is sent to the POST `/api/chat` endpoint.
- Internally, the Agent Orchestrator (in `lib/orchestrator.ts`) is called to parse and process the query.

**Intent Analysis**

- OpenAI (via `analyzeUserQuery()`) identifies the query's main intent (e.g., MARKET_DATA, DEPLOY_CONTRACT).
- Entities like token addresses or amounts are extracted.

**Data Requirements / Blockchain Operations**

- If the intent is about market data, aggregator calls to external APIs (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap) occur.
- If it involves blockchain activity (deploy, transfer, etc.), the request is handed to the Blockchain Orchestrator (`blockchain-orchestrator.ts`).

**Conversation Context**

- Meanwhile, conversation logs are stored in ConversationStore (in `lib/conversation-store.ts`).
- This maintains a list of recent messages, user preferences, and transaction history.

**Response Generation**

- Once data or actions are complete, a summarization prompt is built and sent back through OpenAI to format the final text.
- The final response is returned to the user as JSON, which the frontend chat interface displays.

### 3.2 Major Components

**Agent Orchestrator** (`lib/orchestrator.ts`):

- The central router for each user query.
- Calls `analyzeUserQuery` → decides if it needs data from aggregator or blockchain agents → calls `generateSummary`.

**OpenAI**:

- Used for both intent classification (Which type of question is this?) and response generation (Formulating a friendly final answer).

**Aggregator Agents** (`lib/agents/aggregator.ts`, etc.):

- Handle external data calls for crypto prices, trending tokens, or fallback to alternative APIs.

**Blockchain Orchestrator** (`lib/agents/blockchain-orchestrator.ts`):

- Coordinates wallet connections, token transfers, and contract deployments.
- Works with sessionManager (for persistent wallet sessions) and specialized transaction or deployment agents.

**Conversation Store** (`lib/conversation-store.ts`):

- Maintains a context object containing user messages, favorite tokens, dominant conversation topics, etc.
- Ensures that the AI can reference prior questions or user-specific knowledge (e.g., "Your favorite token is ETH").

**Frontend** (Next.js + React):

- Presents a ChatInterface component for user input and conversation display.
- Includes specialized UI for blockchain testing (`/blockchain-test` page) and wallet connection logic.

### 3.3 Data Flow Diagram

```
User → [Chat UI] → /api/chat → [Agent Orchestrator]
       (Frontend)             |
                              |--- Intent Analysis -> [OpenAI]
                              |--- Data Aggregation -> [CoinGecko, CMC APIs]
                              |--- Blockchain Ops -> [Blockchain Orchestrator]
                              |
                              → [Conversation Store] → Logs messages
                              → [OpenAI] -> Summarization
                              → Response back to user
```

### 3.4 Session & State Management

- **Server-Side**: The conversation store and session manager track state in-memory on the server.
- **Client-Side**: Minimal state except for storing sessionId.
- **Mocks**: The environment can be configured for local tests to bypass real blockchain endpoints.

In essence, Next.js acts as both the server (with specialized route handlers) and the client (React-based UI), while orchestrator classes unify the logic behind the scenes.

## 4. Getting Started

Below are the prerequisite steps and basic commands to set up the project locally.

### 4.1 Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 18**
  - Using a more recent Node.js version is recommended to ensure the viability of ES modules, Viem, etc.
- **npm or yarn**
  - Project scripts assume npm; adapt if using yarn.
- **OpenAI API Key**
  - Required for conversation intelligence and summary generation.
- **Optional: CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap API keys**
  - Without these, the system may still function but can be limited by public rate limits.

### 4.2 Installation Steps

**Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/blockchain-ai-agent.git
cd blockchain-ai-agent
```

**Install Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```
This pulls all required packages (Next.js, solc, OpenAI, etc.).

**Create .env File**:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Populate it with your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `COINGECKO_API_KEY`, `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY`, and `MAINNET_RPC_URL` or `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`.

**Run Dev Server**:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Defaults to http://localhost:3000.
You can now visit the chat interface and begin testing.

### 4.3 Common Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start development server (hot reload).
- `npm run build`: Build for production.
- `npm run start`: Start the production build.
- `npm run lint`: Check code linting.
- `npm run blockchain:node`: Spawn local Hardhat blockchain.
- `npm run blockchain:deploy`: Deploy sample contracts to local node.
- `npm run blockchain:test`: Run contract-based tests.
- `npm run test:agents`: Specialized tests for the AI agent logic.

### 4.4 Checking the Installation

After `npm run dev`, navigate to:

- `/` (Home): The default landing.
- `/blockchain-test`: A dedicated test page to manually connect wallet (mock or real) and send transactions.

If everything is functioning, you should see a chat interface. Test queries, e.g.:

- "What is the price of Bitcoin?"
- "Deploy an ERC20 token called MyTestToken with supply 1000000."
- "Send 0.05 ETH to 0x1234...5678."

## 5. Environment Setup

This section covers advanced environment configurations, including local vs. remote blockchains and mock vs. real wallets.

### 5.1 Local vs. External RPC

**Local (Hardhat)**:

- `npm run blockchain:node` to spin up a Hardhat local blockchain (on port 8545).
- Use `USE_HARDHAT=true` in your .env or add localhost as `RPC_URL`.
- Then, for more realistic testing, `npm run blockchain:deploy` to deploy test contracts.

**Testnets (Sepolia, etc.)**:

- Provide `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` in .env.
- Make sure your wallet has test ETH to cover gas.
- `USE_TESTNET=true` if you want to run on Sepolia by default.

**Mainnet**:

- Provide `MAINNET_RPC_URL` (Alchemy, Infura, etc.).
- `USE_TESTNET=false` and ensure you're comfortable with actual mainnet transactions.

### 5.2 Wallet Connections

**Mock Wallet**:

- For easy testing without real funds, set `USE_BLOCKCHAIN_MOCKS=true`.
- This uses an in-memory "wallet" that simulates addresses, transactions, and confirmations.

**MetaMask / Real Wallet**:

- Set `USE_BLOCKCHAIN_MOCKS=false`.
- The application will attempt to connect with the browser's Ethereum provider (`window.ethereum`).
- You can switch networks in MetaMask. Just ensure your .env matches the chain you're on.

### 5.3 OpenAI Configuration

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is mandatory for the conversation logic to function.
- You can specify `OPENAI_MODEL` if you have access to other model versions (e.g., GPT-4). By default, the code references `process.env.OPENAI_MODEL` or a fallback model name.

### 5.4 Rate Limits and API Fallbacks

- If CoinGecko hits a rate limit, the aggregator automatically tries CoinMarketCap, and vice versa.
- Adjust `COINGECKO_RATE_LIMIT` or `COINMARKETCAP_RATE_LIMIT` in your environment if you have advanced API plans with different quotas.

### 5.5 Logging & Monitoring

- Logs appear in your terminal where `npm run dev` (or `npm run start`) is running.
- For more robust monitoring (uptime, usage metrics), you can integrate with external services (New Relic, Datadog) or write logs to an external location.

## 6. Project Structure

The repository is organized to separate concerns between the frontend UI, server-side APIs, and specialized modules within `lib/`. This structure ensures clarity when making changes or debugging specific components (like blockchain operations or AI-related logic).

### 6.1 Key Folders

- **app/api/**: All HTTP endpoints in Next.js. Each route's logic is minimal, delegating to lib/.
- **components/**: React components for the chat UI, forms, modal dialogs, etc.
- **lib/agents/**: "Agents" that handle specialized tasks (intent analysis, aggregator calls, blockchain actions).
- **lib/blockchain/**: Underlying wallet interactions, session management, and Ethereum RPC handling.
- **lib/conversation-store.ts**: Maintains short-term conversation memory, user-specific preferences, and context analysis.

### 6.2 Why This Structure?

- **Clear Separation**: Each agent has a focused domain (intent detection, aggregator, transaction handling), so changes to one agent won't break unrelated logic.
- **Testing**: Hardhat config is separate from Next.js code, enabling easy local blockchain testing.
- **Extensibility**: Additional contract templates, aggregator APIs, or AI routines can be dropped into `lib/agents/` with minimal friction.
- **Next.js Integration**: By leveraging the `app/` folder, route definitions are transparent and can integrate seamlessly with SSR or serverless deployments.

## 7. How It Works

The "How It Works" section provides a step-by-step breakdown of the system's end-to-end flow when the user makes a query.

### 7.1 End-to-End Flow Example

**Use Case**: The user enters the chat and says, "Deploy an ERC20 token called MyToken with symbol MTK and initial supply of 1,000,000."

**User Query**

- The user's request is sent via a POST request to `/api/chat`.
- The front-end includes a sessionId so the system can recall this user's context.

**Agent Orchestrator** (`lib/orchestrator.ts`)

- The orchestrator's `processQuery(query, sessionId)` is invoked.
- It first calls `analyzeUserQuery(...)` (OpenAI) to classify the query as DEPLOY_CONTRACT.

**Conversation Context**

- The system logs this user's message to the ConversationStore, linking it with the intent, tokens, and any relevant metadata.
- The conversation memory updates to reflect a mention of "MyToken," "MTK," and the requested supply.

**Blockchain Action**

- Because the intent is DEPLOY_CONTRACT, the orchestrator calls the Blockchain Orchestrator (`blockchain-orchestrator.ts`) with a DEPLOY_CONTRACT action.
- Inside, it figures out which contract template to use (ERC20). It populates parameters from the user's text (name=MyToken, symbol=MTK, supply=1,000,000).

**Smart Contract Deployment**

- The ContractDeploymentAgent compiles or uses a pre-compiled ERC20 template.
- A transaction is sent through the user's active wallet (if not connected, the system may prompt "Connect your wallet").
- The transaction hash is recorded in the transaction registry and conversation memory.

**Transaction Monitoring**

- As the transaction is mined, an event listener updates the transaction status from pending → success or failed.
- The system can re-check the transaction each time for confirmations.

**Response Generation**

- Meanwhile, aggregator data isn't needed here (no price request).
- The orchestrator calls `generateSummary(...)` with the context and results from the deployment.
- OpenAI returns a friendly response, e.g., "Your contract is being deployed with transaction hash 0xABC... You'll receive confirmation soon."

**Final Chat Response**

- The front-end receives the JSON response.
- The user sees a message indicating the contract deployment is in progress and a short snippet of the transaction hash.
- If they later ask, "What's the status of my deployment?", the system checks the stored transaction record.

### 7.2 Internal Modules in Action

- **intent.ts**: Sends the user text to an OpenAI prompt designed for classification. It returns a JSON structure indicating the primary intent (e.g., DEPLOY_CONTRACT), confidence, and relevant entities.
- **aggregator.ts**: If the query needed market data, it fetches from CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap.
- **session-manager.ts**: Ensures the user's wallet connection persists across multiple queries. If the user is not connected, it either uses a mock or prompts them to connect a real wallet.
- **conversation-store.ts**: Maintains a rolling log of messages, user preferences (like favorite tokens), and a continuity score. This ensures the system remains contextually aware.
- **transaction-api.ts**: Provides a unified record for transactions, so the system can quickly find the status of a user's transfers or deployments.

### 7.3 Chain of Responsibility

1. Frontend → POST `/api/chat`
2. Chat Route → calls AgentOrchestrator
3. AgentOrchestrator → Intent Analysis + possibly Data Aggregation or Blockchain Orchestrator
4. Blockchain Orchestrator → e.g., ContractDeploymentAgent
5. ContractDeploymentAgent → compiles & sends transaction
6. Transaction events → stored in logs + updated back in conversation context
7. Orchestrator → Response Summarization → returns to user

By following this layered approach, the system keeps each concern modular. Adding a new type of operation (like NFT minting, bridging tokens, or advanced DeFi analysis) just means extending the appropriate agent or aggregator. The user's experience remains consistent: they simply ask the AI assistant in plain English, and the system orchestrates the behind-the-scenes steps.

## 9. Testing

The Blockchain AI Agent implements both frontend and backend testing strategies, focusing on agent logic, blockchain interactions, and overall system robustness.

### 9.1 Types of Tests

**Agent Tests** (`npm run test:agents`):

- These tests check core AI logic, such as intent classification, aggregator calls, and summarization routines.
- Mocks are used for external APIs (CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap) and OpenAI to avoid real network calls.
- Verifies that the system correctly categorizes queries (e.g., "What is the price of Bitcoin?" → MARKET_DATA).

**Blockchain Tests** (`npm run blockchain:test`):

- Uses Hardhat to spin up a local Ethereum environment.
- Runs Solidity contract tests, verifying deployment success, token transfers, expected behaviors, etc.
- Ensures the contract templates (ERC20, NFT) compile and behave correctly on a local chain.

**Integration / End-to-End**:

- While not always formalized in the repository, you can simulate user flows:
  - Run `npm run blockchain:node` to start a local Hardhat node.
  - Connect a mock or real wallet on `/blockchain-test`.
  - Deploy a contract or transfer tokens.
  - Verify the chat interface displays the correct transaction status.
- If desired, a library like Playwright or Cypress can automate these UI flows.

### 9.2 How to Run Tests

**Agent Tests**:

```bash
npm run test:agents
```
This might invoke a Node.js script or a test framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest) that checks the logic in `lib/agents/` and `lib/orchestrator.ts`.

**Blockchain Node Tests**:

```bash
npm run blockchain:node         # Start local Hardhat network in one terminal
npm run blockchain:deploy       # Optionally deploy test contracts
npm run blockchain:test         # Run contract-based tests
```
These typically use the Hardhat testing framework, plus Chai matchers.

### 9.3 Testing Tips

- **Use Mocks**: For AI classification, you can mock OpenAI responses to ensure your pipeline handles known JSON structures.
- **Debugging**: If a blockchain test fails, check the logs from the Hardhat console for transaction revert messages.
- **Coverage**: Tools like solidity-coverage can measure how much of your smart contract code is tested.
- **Front-End Tests**: (Optional) can be added with Cypress or Playwright to script user flows (like opening the chat, sending a message, and verifying the response).

## 10. Future Improvements

Below are potential enhancements to further advance the Blockchain AI Agent's capabilities and user experience.

### Multi-Chain / Cross-Chain Support

- Currently focused on Ethereum (mainnet and testnets).
- Integrating additional networks (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Binance Smart Chain, etc.) would allow cross-chain bridging and queries.

### Voice Interface

- Allow voice-based queries and spoken responses for a more hands-free experience.
- Could use a speech-to-text library on the front end and text-to-speech for the assistant replies.

### DeFi Protocol Support

- Built-in knowledge of popular DEXs, lending protocols, and yield farms.
- Let users stake tokens or provide liquidity simply by requesting it in the chat.

### Advanced Data Analytics

- On-chain analysis: track large wallet movements, DeFi liquidation events, or real-time trading signals.
- Integrate sentiment analysis from social media or news.

### Smart Contract Security

- Expand contract validator to run static analysis or connect to advanced auditing tools.
- Provide automated checks for reentrancy, integer overflow, or design-level flaws.

### Enhanced Context Memory

- Extend beyond short-term conversation memory to a user profile saved in a database (e.g., storing a user's long-term preferences or their commonly deployed contracts).

### UI/UX Improvements

- More visual dashboards for token prices, charts, and transaction logs.
- Rich push notifications for transaction confirmations or price alerts.

### Formal Verification

- Integrate formal verification tools like Certora or MythX to run deeper contract checks on demand.

By implementing these features, the agent can evolve into a comprehensive blockchain assistant, providing everything from casual market insight to advanced multi-chain DeFi operations.
